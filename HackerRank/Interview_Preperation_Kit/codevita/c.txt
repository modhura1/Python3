Philaland Club
Problem Description
Coders of Philaland have come up with a sport to test smartness of coders on the Island. Ada and Grace were assigned a task to organize teams to set-up the challenging problems for the sport. Ada nominated some programmers and categorized them on the basis their competitive programming experience. Programmers with experience greater than 5 years are in category A whereas rest are in category B .

Grace suggested that there should be exactly  K  programmers of category A in a team. However, there is no limit on the number of programmers of category B . M  and  N  numbers of programmers are present in category A  and  B  respectively.

Grace wants to know the number of ways she can form a team using above information.

Grace and Ada are busy with environment setup for the sport, so they asked you to help them.

Since the answer could be very large, print answer modulo 1000000007.

Constraints
1<=T<=10000

1<=M<=500000

1<=N<= 500000

K<=M

Input Format
First line provides an integer T denoting number of test cases.

Next T lines contain three space separated integers 

M:= number of programmers of category A 

N:= Number of programmers of category B and 

K:= Number of programmers of category A , required in a team.

Output
For each test case T print a single line containing the answer. 

Test Case

Explanation
Example 1

Input

1

3 1 2

Output

6

Explanation

Here M=3, N=1, K=2

Letâ€™s denote A1, A2, A3 be the programmers from A category and B1 from B category.

The requirement of programmers from A category is K = 2. Hence following are possible ways to make a team.

A1 , A2 , B1

A1 , A3 , 

A2 , A3 , 

A1 , A3 , B1

A1 , A2

A2 , A3 , B1

Input

1

4 1 3

Output

8

Explanation

Here M=4, N=1, K=3

Lets denote A1, A2, A3, A4 be the programmers from A category and B1 from B category.

The requirement of programmers from A category is K = 3. Therefore only 8 teams are possible.
