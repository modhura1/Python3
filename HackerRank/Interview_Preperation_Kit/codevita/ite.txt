Iterate Base
Problem Description
Given a number representation, we can identify the base that would result in a least value for the representation.  Consider the following examples:

1. For the number representation 11, the least possible base is 2 and hence the least possible value is 3 in base 10.

2. For 17, the least possible base is 8 and the least possible value is 15 in base 10.

3. For 1729, the least possible base in 10 and the least possible value is 1729 in base 10.

Consider doing this base reduction iteratively till a fixed point is reached as shown in the following example: Let's start with number representation 72. The least possible value of 72 is in base 8 and is 58 (represented in base 10). Iterating, the least possible value of 58 is in base 9 and is 53 (base 10). In the next iteration, 53 (in base 6) becomes 33. Then, 33 (base 4) gives 15; 15 (base 6) gives 11; 11 (base 2) gives 3. Finally, 3 remains 3 (in bases 4 and above).

Write a program to accept a number representation, perform the successive base reductions as above and print the resulting final number.

Constraints
1. The length of input number representation <= 5

2. Maximum base = 36

3. Symbols used for digits: Base 2: 0, 1
Base 3: 0, 1, 2
...
Base 11: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A

…

Base 36: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

4. Face values for symbols: Symbol => Value 0 => 0
1 => 1
2 => 2
….
9 => 9
A => 10
B => 11
….
Z => 35

Input Format
One line containing a number representation (See Examples section for better understanding)

Output
The final number representation that results from iteratively performing base reductions in the manner illustrated above

Test Case

Explanation
Example 1

Input

25

Output

3

Explanation

Starting with 25, we have the following transitions: 25 -> base 6 => 17 -> base 8 => 15 -> base 6 => 11 -> base 2 => 3, which is the fixed point

Example 2

Input

TCS

Output

17900

Explanation

Starting with TCS, TCS -> base 30 => 29*30^2+12*30+28=26488 -> base 9 => 2*9^4+6*9^3+4*9^2+8*9+8=17900 -> base 10 => 17900, which is the fixed point
